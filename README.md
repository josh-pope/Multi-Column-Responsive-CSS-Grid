# Multi-Column-Responsive-CSS-Grid
There are literally TONS of libraries out there to create responsive css grids and columns.. And they are usually bloated with too much css. I found rolling my own solution was a much better option. This is a very paired down example of a 3 column grid that will go to 2 columns, then 1. It is absolutely ideal for desktop/tablet/mobile layouts- however it is also an excellent way to build full bleed websites that look great at any browser size (and looks great WHILE the user is manually resizing the browser window.. ) See code to adjust break points.


This page works standalone. Just copy the file to your hard drive and run it.

I have built this into a SASS include/mixin framework. Message me if you want it.

This is currently being used in a large scale production application and has passed many tests across many browsers. Stay tuned for a really amazing production example in the wild.

If you use this please let me know! I will link to you from the official site(coming), Twitter and GitHub.. So why not?
